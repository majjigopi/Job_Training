Method And Constructor Reference (::) :
  
  Method Reference :
        This method referer (::) is used to refer one method in to another method like suppose we have 
         int i=6;
         int j;
         j=i;
          
          here we are refering int variable i into j 
          
          simlarly if we have two methods we can refer one method into another method see the MethodReferenceinterf and test example 
          
          conditions:
          ----------
             To impliment method reference. two referer and refering method should have same arguments 
             
             
           example :
           ---------
               look in to Interf(interface) and Test(class) 
               
               
   Constructor Reference : 
   		
   			Constructoe can be easily reference by using       AbstractInterface f=ClassName::new ; the return type of abstract interface method should be ClassName type;
